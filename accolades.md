Projects: 
- Solid State Physics (experimental): Served on a semiconductor research team developing techniques synthesizing 14-1-11 Zenithil Crystals (single-domain).
- Solid State Physics (theoretical):  Developed molecular dynamic simulations using Leonard Jones and Monte Carlo models. Additionally, worked on models of perturbed systems of a 2D n x n array skewed lattice crystalline structure.
- Geology : Served on a semiconductor research team developing a Data Visualization Tool for analyzing First-Order Reversal Curves and their multidimensional Transformations. The raw geological data was aquired via polar ice core Datasets. The Transformations produced contour plots where reseachers could slice and drill into the data two-dimensionally.
