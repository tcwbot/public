Projects: 
- Solid State Physics (experimental): Developed techniques synthesyzing 14-1-11 Zenithil Crystals (single-domain).
- Solid State Physics (theoretical):  Developed Molecular Dynamic Simulations using Leonard Jones and Monte Carlo models.
- Geology : Developed a Data Visualization Tool for analyzing First-Order Reversal Curves and their multidimensional Transformations on Ice Core Datasets. The Transformations produced contour plots where reseachers could slice and drill into the data two-dimensionally.
