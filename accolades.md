## City College of San Francisco
[Computer Programming: Java Certificate of Achievement](https://ccsf.curricunet.com/Report/Program/GetReport/893?reportId=29)

Projects:
- Academic Project, Led by [Pr. Aaron Brick](https://github.com/aaronbrick)<br/>
- Experimented with adding probabilistic judgments based on Corpus linguistics to an OCR system(Tesseract-OCR).

## University of California, Davis
[Bachelor of Arts - AB, Physics](https://physics.ucdavis.edu/)

Projects: 
- Solid State Physics (experimental): Developed techniques synthesyzing 14-1-11 Zenithil Crystals (single-domain).
- Solid State Physics (theoretical):  Developed Molecular Dynamic Simulations using Leonard Jones and Monte Carlo models.
- Geology : Developed a Data Visualization Tool for analyzing First-Order Reversal Curves and their multidimensional Transformations on Ice Core Datasets. The Transformations produced contour plots where reseachers could slice and drill into the data two-dimensionally.
