## Professional Role (Current)

### Senior Support Engineer - IBM

Operating across three parallel responsibilities:

#### 1) Technical Lead - Support Team
- Serve as technical lead for a support team, guiding complex case resolution and mentoring engineers on system-level debugging and architectural reasoning.
- Act as escalation point for high-complexity issues requiring deep product, platform, and infrastructure understanding.
- Influence support practices toward repeatable solutions, long-term defect reduction, and improved operational maturity.

#### 2) SDK Contributor
- Contribute directly to SDK development, translating real-world customer issues into platform-level improvements.
- Identify systemic gaps surfaced through support interactions and convert them into actionable code-level changes.
- Collaborate with engineering teams to improve developer experience, reliability, and maintainability.

#### 3) AI & Automation Initiatives
- Work with a Senior Technical Staff Member (STSM) on AI-driven automation and internal tooling initiatives.
- Contribute to projects leveraging IBM Orchestrate, agentic workflows, and internal automation frameworks.
- Focus on reducing operational toil, scaling expert knowledge, and embedding AI-assisted decision-making into support and engineering workflows.
